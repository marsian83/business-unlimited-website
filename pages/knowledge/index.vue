          Coaching v/s Mentoring v/s Consulting v/s Training: What is the
          difference?
        </h1>
        <p>
          To make a ‘positive’ change in YOUR life, it always ‘helps’ to speak
          to someone who is a ‘neutral and professional’ person, outside your
          inner circle - family, friends and colleagues. Some of the services
          available are : Coaching, Mentoring, Consulting and Training - which
          have been of immense help to a lot of people and organizations towards
          better life to achieving goals. They could be often confused and used
          interchangeably. While these services ‘help’ you towards your
          objective, there could be an overlap.

          Coaching v/s Mentoring : <br />Directive and non-directive
        </h1>
        <p>
          Mentoring is directive while Coaching is non-directive. A Mentor does
          more of the talking, whereas in Coaching it is likely that the Coach
          poses questions and gives the space to the other person, to reflect
          and do the talking.

        <h1 class="heading">Short Term and Long Term</h1>
        <p>
          Mentoring is often long-term with some relationships lasting for years
          and few examples could be artists, actors and sportsmen to help them
          at every stage of their career. Coaching is short-term and
          goal-oriented, and often when the goals are fulfilled, it may come to
          a conclusion.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h1 class="heading">Qualifications</h1>
        <p>
          Mentoring is sought based on the Mentor’s skills or experience in the
          desired field. Whereas Coaches need not be the subject matter experts.
          They need to acquire an expertise through training and credentialing
          processes with International recognized Organisations.

        <h1 class="heading">Coaching vs Training <br />End result</h1>
        <p>
          Training typically enhances a skill set or knowledge of the person who
          is being trained. Coaching makes a person an improved version of their
          own self

        <h1 class="heading">Goals and accountability</h1>
        <p>
          Training goals and methodology is typically decided by people other
          than the person being trained. Coaching goals and outcome ownership is
          taken by the person who is being coached
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h1 class="heading">Empowering</h1>
        <p>
          Training empowers with additional knowledge and skill set. Coaching
          empowers with awareness and improved belief, an innate ability all of
          us have. Despite the above differences, all the above interventions
          have been evolving and are sought after by individuals, professionals,
          c-suite executives, businesses (of any size) and organizations as they
          involve educating, developing, enabling growth and guiding. In many
          parts of the world ‘Coaching’ is taken as ‘best practice’ to bring
          ‘self’ - awareness, care and empowerment.
