              It is a privilege to be a mentee with Anamika. I have learnt great
              things from her resourcefulness. I have since grown and do
              contribute it partly to her kindness and perseverance as my
              mentor. Her sharing of her own professional and personal
              experiences inspired and influenced me which then led to critical
              insights to work on my blind spots. My learnings to deal with
              complex and ambiguous situations, difficult people has been
              instrumental in my growth both as a professional and a person
