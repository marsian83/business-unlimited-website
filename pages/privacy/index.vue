  <p class="py-3 text-2xl font-semibold">WHAT INFORMATION DOES BU COLLECT FROM YOU?</p>
  <p>
    Via the Site, BU may collect from you: (i) certain personally identifiable
    information, and (ii) technical and other information.
  </p>
  <p class="py-3 text-2xl font-semibold">PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    Contacting Us &nbsp;&ndash; The Site permits you to contact us via email or
    via various forms. &nbsp;Whenever you send an email or otherwise communicate
    with us via the Site, you may be providing us with your name, email address,
    company name, business type, product interest, any other required fields,
    and any information you choose to include in the text of your message.
    &nbsp;For example, you may choose to provide your mailing address or other
    information necessary or helpful for us to address your query or other
    concern.

  <p>
    Downloading Materials &mdash; The Site permits you to download various
    materials, such as articles, white papers, blogs, brochures. Whenever you

    with your name, email address, company name, business type, product
    interest, any other required fields, and any information you choose to
    include in the text of your message.
  </p>
  <p>
    Technical and Other Information. BU uses commonly used automated
    information-gathering tools. &nbsp;While you are browsing the Site, we
    automatically log your IP address (a number assigned to your computer when
    you use the Internet), general data (including your domain name and the name
    of the web page from which you entered the Site) and your activity while
    using the Site. &nbsp;Additionally, in order to personalize and enhance your
    experience on the Site, we may also collect information through
    &ldquo;cookies.&rdquo; Cookies are small strings of text that are sent by
    the Site to your browser and then stored by your browser on your
    computer&rsquo;s hard drive. We use cookies to help diagnose problems with
    our servers and to administer the Site. &nbsp;We also use cookies to gather
    broad demographic information and to help identify you (by certain
    personally identifiable information) in respect to visits to the Site so
    that we may improve your user experience, and to determine whether you
    visited the Site from a particular Internet link or advertisement. BU may
    also use small bits of code called &ldquo;one-pixel gifs,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;clear gifs,&rdquo; or &ldquo;web beacons&rdquo; embedded in web pages
    to gather certain web site information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Information may also be collected passively in the form of logs files that
    record website activity, including how many &ldquo;hits&rdquo; a particular
    web page is getting (a.k.a. &ldquo;click-through data&rdquo;). For example,
    log file entries are generated every time a User visits a particular page or
    clicks an image on the Site. These entries enable BU to track a particular
    User&rsquo;s visits to a web page, assess overall Site activity, track
    interest in particular portions of the Site, troubleshoot technical
    concerns, and identify the type of browser you are using. We may also use
    the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so
    we can constantly improve the Site.
  </p>
  <p>
    To the extent that the Site ever displays third party advertisements, such
    advertisements, may also contain cookies sent by Internet advertising
    companies or advertisers (known as &ldquo;third party cookies&rdquo;). Most
    web browsers automatically accept cookies, but it is possible to change your
    browser setup so that it warns you each time a cookie is being sent, blocks
    third party cookies or blocks or rejects all cookies. However, rejecting
    cookies may prevent you from taking advantage of certain portions of the
    Site.
