    </p>
    <p>
      Via the Site, BU may collect from you: (i) certain personally identifiable
      information, and (ii) technical and other information.
    </p>
    <p class="py-3 text-2xl font-semibold">
      PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Contacting Us &nbsp;&ndash; The Site permits you to contact us via email
      or via various forms. &nbsp;Whenever you send an email or otherwise
      communicate with us via the Site, you may be providing us with your name,
      email address, company name, business type, product interest, any other
      required fields, and any information you choose to include in the text of
      your message. &nbsp;For example, you may choose to provide your mailing
      address or other information necessary or helpful for us to address your
      query or other concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Downloading Materials &mdash; The Site permits you to download various
      materials, such as articles, white papers, blogs, brochures. Whenever you
      fill out a form required to download such materials, you may be providing
      us with your name, email address, company name, business type, product
      interest, any other required fields, and any information you choose to
      include in the text of your message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technical and Other Information. BU uses commonly used automated
      information-gathering tools. &nbsp;While you are browsing the Site, we
      automatically log your IP address (a number assigned to your computer when
      you use the Internet), general data (including your domain name and the
      name of the web page from which you entered the Site) and your activity
      while using the Site. &nbsp;Additionally, in order to personalize and
      enhance your experience on the Site, we may also collect information
      through &ldquo;cookies.&rdquo; Cookies are small strings of text that are
      sent by the Site to your browser and then stored by your browser on your
      computer&rsquo;s hard drive. We use cookies to help diagnose problems with
      our servers and to administer the Site. &nbsp;We also use cookies to
      gather broad demographic information and to help identify you (by certain
      personally identifiable information) in respect to visits to the Site so
      that we may improve your user experience, and to determine whether you
      visited the Site from a particular Internet link or advertisement. BU may
      also use small bits of code called &ldquo;one-pixel gifs,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;clear gifs,&rdquo; or &ldquo;web beacons&rdquo; embedded in web
      pages to gather certain web site information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information may also be collected passively in the form of logs files that
      record website activity, including how many &ldquo;hits&rdquo; a
      particular web page is getting (a.k.a. &ldquo;click-through data&rdquo;).
      For example, log file entries are generated every time a User visits a
      particular page or clicks an image on the Site. These entries enable BU to
      track a particular User&rsquo;s visits to a web page, assess overall Site
      activity, track interest in particular portions of the Site, troubleshoot
      technical concerns, and identify the type of browser you are using. We may
      also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic
      studies, so we can constantly improve the Site.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the extent that the Site ever displays third party advertisements, such
      advertisements, may also contain cookies sent by Internet advertising
      companies or advertisers (known as &ldquo;third party cookies&rdquo;).
      Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but it is possible to
      change your browser setup so that it warns you each time a cookie is being
      sent, blocks third party cookies or blocks or rejects all cookies.
      However, rejecting cookies may prevent you from taking advantage of
      certain portions of the Site.
